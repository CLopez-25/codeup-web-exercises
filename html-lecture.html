      <h2>Some of my favorite quotes:</h2>
      <hr>
      <p>Shakespear said: <q>All the world's a stage.</q></p>
      <blockquote>
          All the world’s a stage,<br>
          And all the men and women merely players;<br>
          They have their exits and their entrances,<br>
          And one man in his time plays many parts,<br>
          His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,<br>
          Mewling and puking in the nurse’s arms.<br>
          Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel<br>
          And shining morning face, creeping like snail<br>
          Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,<br>
          Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad<br>
          Made to his mistress’ eyebrow. Then a soldier,<br>
          Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,<br>
          Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,<br>
          Seeking the bubble reputation<br>
          Even in the cannon’s mouth. And then the justice,<br>
          In fair round belly with good capon lined,<br>
          With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,<br>
          Full of wise saws and modern instances;<br>
          And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts<br>
          Into the lean and slippered pantaloon,<br>
          With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;<br>
          His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide<br>
          For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice,<br>
          Turning again toward childish treble, pipes<br>
          And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,<br>
          That ends this strange eventful history,<br>
          Is second childishness and mere oblivion,<br>
          Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.<br>

<!--
 html is the parent tag
 head and body tags are siblings
 make sure you markup your content! i.e <p></p>
 element consists of an opening tag and a closing tag

 heading elements/ h1-h6
 h1 is a heading element

 ul= unordered lists
 ol= ordered lists
 li= list item
 li*# will give you the number of list items you want
 table will have tr(table row), th(table heading), and td(table data)

 inline element will not disrupt the flow of the page.
 blockquote will get indented and creates a separate block on the page.

 <br> is a void element- doesn't need a closing tag.
 <hr> is a horizontal line on the page.

 ****OPTION/SHIFT/G- cursor on everything you highlighted****
